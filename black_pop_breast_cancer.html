  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This project examines racial disparities in breast cancer outcomes across the
    United States by combining demographic and health data at the county level.
    Since breast cancer mortality is consistently higher among Black women,
    this analysis focuses on identifying where Black populations are most
    concentrated and how mortality rates differ by race spatially.
  </p>
  <p>
    The maps created in this lab are intended to support public health planning
    by highlighting counties where the population-level burden of breast cancer
    mortality may be greatest and where targeted intervention efforts may be most
    impactful.
  </p>

<section class="container data-methods">
  <h2>Data & Methods</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Demographic Data:</strong> U.S. Census county-level population data</li>
    <li><strong>Health Data:</strong> Breast cancer mortality rates by race</li>
    <li><strong>Spatial Unit:</strong> U.S. counties</li>
    <li><strong>Software:</strong> QGIS</li>
    <li><strong>Techniques:</strong> Choropleth mapping, data classification, spatial comparison</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Population proportions and mortality rates were mapped using standardized
    classification schemes to allow comparison across counties and regions.
    Rates were used rather than raw counts to ensure meaningful spatial interpretation.

  <h2>Map 1: Black Population Distribution Across U.S. Counties</h2>
  <p>
    Since Black individuals experience higher breast cancer mortality nationally,
    this map classifies U.S. counties based on the proportion of Black residents.
    Counties where Black residents comprise <strong>50% or more</strong> of the total
    population are categorized as <strong>high Black population</strong> counties,
    those with <strong>20% to 49.9%</strong> as <strong>moderate</strong>, and those
    with <strong>less than 20%</strong> as <strong>low</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This classification highlights where Black communities are most spatially
    concentrated and where the <strong>population-level impact of breast cancer
    mortality disparities may be most significant</strong>, providing a demographic
    context for identifying priority areas for public health intervention.

  <h2>Map 2: Breast Cancer Mortality Rate by Race</h2>
  <p>
    In comparison to other racial groups, Black women experience
    <strong>higher breast cancer mortality rates across much of the United States</strong>.
    This map visualizes race-specific breast cancer mortality rates at the county
    level, revealing widespread geographic disparities that persist across regions.
  </p>
  <p>
    By mapping mortality rates rather than raw counts, this visualization enables
    meaningful comparison across counties and highlights areas where inequities
    in health outcomes may reflect differences in access to screening, treatment,
    and broader structural healthcare resources.

<section class="container discussion">
  <h2>Discussion</h2>
  <p>
    Together, these maps reveal that regions with high concentrations of Black
    residents often overlap with areas experiencing elevated breast cancer
    mortality among Black women. While population concentration alone does not
    explain mortality outcomes, the spatial patterns suggest that structural
    factors such as healthcare access, screening availability, and socioeconomic
    conditions play a critical role.
  </p>
  <p>
    Identifying these geographic patterns can help inform more equitable public
    health strategies by directing prevention, screening, and treatment resources
    toward communities most affected by breast cancer disparities.
